# Watch Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning
 - watched the firse 20 videos of this series : [Machine Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)
 - Learned the basics again :(
 - Extra things learned :
   - Feature scaling
   - Mean Normalization - Make the features to have approximately zero mean:
     > x<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> - μ) / s  
     > OR  
     > x<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> - μ) / μ
     
     where:
       - μ = mean  
       - s = range
